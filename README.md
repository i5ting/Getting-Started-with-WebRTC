WebRTC is a new front in the long war for an open and unencumbered web. 

by Brendan Eich, inventor of JavaScript

## Real-time communication without plugins

Imagine a world where your phone, TV and computer could all communicate on a common platform. Imagine it was easy to add video chat and peer-to-peer data sharing to your web application. That's the vision of WebRTC.

Want to try it out? WebRTC is available now in Google Chrome, Opera and Firefox. A good place to start is the simple video chat application at apprtc.appspot.com:

1. Open apprtc.appspot.com in Chrome, Opera or Firefox.
1. Click the Allow button to let the app use your web cam.
1. Open the URL displayed at the bottom of the page in a new tab or, better still, on a different computer.

There is a walkthrough of this application [later in this article](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/basics/#toc-simple).
